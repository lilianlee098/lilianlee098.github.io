                </h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Lilian Lee and I am a second year student studying a Bachelor of Design maojoring in Visual Communication Design at Massey University of Wellington, New Zealand. I am a designer and web developer. I love designing posters, websites, literally anything, and branding. My strengths and skills are designing and using final cut pro in terms of the filming and editing aspect of my skills. I have been designing for several years now however, there are always new things to learn like designing websites, using html/css and all that. I am hardworking, friendly, adaptable and quick to learn, allowing me to provide the best service possible.  
                    
                     <br>
                   <br>I'm a bit impatient when it comes to painting and blending that the only option to go for art in school was design. Ever since then I have never looked back. In my college years I designed the Newlands College Arts Awards: poster, ticket and programme and Newlands College media event 'NOSCARS': poster, programme and ticket. Both years I came first equal in Art Design. I also started my own brand called 'i eat rice grains' inspired by my work I did at uni in my first year. 
                </p>
                
                 <h3>MY STORY</h3>
               <p>I am a New Zealand born Chinese raised in the little suburb Newlands, here in Wellington City. My parents are both Malaysian born Chinese and moved to New Zealand about 25 years ago. When I was 9 years old, my family and I moved across the ditch to Gold Coast, Australia for 1 1/2 years. It was one of the best years of my life, being able to live in the Australian heat and jump straight into the pool in my backyard everyday after school. We then moved back to New Zealand and have been in Wellington ever since.
                   <br>
                   <br>I have always loved the arts. One of the first memories that I remember back when I was a kid was dancing and singing on the living room floor watching the music videos to the ‘The Ketchup Song’ by Las Ketchup and ‘Complicated’ by Avril Lavigne on TV that my mum would put on for me. From then on I’ve always looked up to my older siblings and always wanted to do what they did. This meant that when they started drawing, I started drawing too. Ever since then I have been hooked by the arts, participating in the school musicals, busking, and doing my own drawings and paintings in my room.
